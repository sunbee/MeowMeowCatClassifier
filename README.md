# Logistic Regression with a Neural Network mindset
## This notebook presents a prototypical image recognition algorithm. It is a cat classifier that recognizes cats with 70% accuracy!

What to use this notebook for:
- Use logistic regression to build intuition about neural networks. 
- Apply gradient descent in simplest and unadorned form.
- Set up the cost function and and update parameters iteratively with computed gradients.

The logistic regression is a powerful modeling technique in itself.
